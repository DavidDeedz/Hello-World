# Hello-World

My first repository.

My current goal is to learn javascript in an effort to apply the language to Google Apps Script. 'Why?', you might ask. Well, let me explain. In my previous roles as an operations manager, tons of time and effort were spent trying to source and understand data to run the business using make-shift tools that were extremely manual (sheets mainly). The business analysts and engineers capable of providing time saving tools (e.g. sheets or apps that were automated) were too busy to help. I'd like to fill that gap by leveling up my tech skills enough to be able to pull data (including SQL), manipulate, and output data in a way that allows business managers to focus on core business initiatives. 

Interestingly, I'm finding the web dev world quite fascinating and finding myself scouring the web for info and context, signing up for meet-up events, and coding daily (rookie status). At this point, I may just keep it going past the world of GAS. :)
