# Hello-World
My first repository. I will use this for all my sample codes, primarily used on Edabit and other code learning sites. 
My current goal is to learn javascript in an effort to apply the language to Google Apps Script. Interestingly, I'm finding the web dev world quite fascinating and finding myself scouring the web for info and context, signing up for meet-up events, and coding daily (rookie status).
